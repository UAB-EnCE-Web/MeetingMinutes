## Topics of Discussion

* Feedback from Web Center (via Grant)
	* Overall very impressed
	* Grant will remain the single point of contact for any necessary edits to the overall ENG site.
	* A new E&CE public site will be developed, largely under the control of E&CE. This will replace the E&CE specific content in the overall ENG site.
		* In place of the development site.
		* When ready, it will be linked from the main site.
		* Eventually this will be the case for all other ENG Depts
		* This site will also have much of the UAB look and feel in place (e.g. top banners, quicklinks, et al.).
	* Front Page Suggestions
		* Suggested remove top banner on main page
		* Need to include more text for accessibility
		* Should include a list of UAB differentiators, not just generic links
			* See landing page examples in resources
		* Company logos cannot be on front page
		* Use less blue, more green
